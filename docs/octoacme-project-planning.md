# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team (include all relevant personas: PM, Developers, UX Designer, DevOps Engineer, Security Lead, Data Analyst)
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria (Product Manager leads, with input from UX Designer and Data Analyst)
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points) — Developers, with DevOps and UX Designer input
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD) — include security requirements (Security Lead), accessibility standards (UX Designer), and monitoring/observability (DevOps Engineer)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points — coordinate across all technical personas
6. Create release plan and milestone map — PM coordinates with DevOps Engineer for deployment windows

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria
- Ensure team capacity is respected

## Risk & Dependency Management
- Capture in Risk Register:
  - ID, Description, Impact, Probability, Owner, Mitigation
- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalate during weekly syncs
